Sinatra App Project
  This application is the result of Flat Iron Schoold Phase 2 project completion. This was part of a software engineering full-time course and was built within the weeks 5-8 of the 20 week course. 

  In this Sinatra application, the idea is of project management. The user gets to create an user account, create projects, edit their own projects and delete them as well. The application starts of by allowing the user to create their own account within the Project Management System, or PMS. They then will be able to do a couple of different things. 

  One, being that they will be able to see ALL projects created by other users, however they are not allowed the ability to edit or delete them if they were not the user that created that project. 

  Second, the user can create their own project by entering a title for the project, and entering in the details or contents of the project. 
  
  Third, once a project has been created, the application will take them to that specific projects detail page where they can edit or delete the project they just created, then resave it again to the database. 

  and finally, as with any application, the user has the ability to log out of their session by clicking the logout link. 

  As this is a web application, there are some styling to this as well. To create the styling, I simply found a template form written in html that I liked and utilized it throughout the application as I do not know much about HTML or CSS, this was the fastes and easiest thing to do to give the application a GU Interface. I did however figure out how to change the coloring of some aspects, and did enjoy exploring that aspect of the development. 

Running the application
  This is a web application, and the required gem 'shotgun' has been placed into the gemfile. After cloning the repository to your text editor, run bundle install and enter into shotgun by typing shotgun into your terminal. Open a web browser and go to localhost:9393 in your address bar. 

  There you will be able to create a user name as well as projects as highlighted above.
